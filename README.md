Letting AI Swipe and Match for You

## UX


### I. Onboarding Flow
1. **Sign-Up:**
   - Simple, clean interface prompting users to sign up via email, social media, or phone.
   - Quick and intuitive verification process.

2. **Open-Ended Prompts:**
   - After signing up, users are guided through customizable, open-ended prompts (e.g., *"What’s your perfect day?"* or *"Describe something you are passionate about."*).
   - Minimalist UI with prompts displayed one at a time, encouraging thoughtful responses.

3. **Profile Creation:**
   - Users upload photos and fill out basic details (name, age, location, interests).
   - The profile preview is shown in the same format that other users will see.



### II. Learning Mode (Swipe Phase)
1. **Swipe Screen:**
   - Familiar swipe interface: **left** for "no" and **right** for "yes." Clean and intuitive, featuring profile pictures, basic info, and selected responses to the open-ended prompts.
   - Users can either swipe or click into a profile to view more details.
   - A subtle **AI learning icon** is visible, indicating that the AI is observing swiping and interaction patterns to refine future matches.

2. **Conversations:**
   - After a match, a minimalist messaging interface opens, encouraging users to chat. The design is simple, focusing on conversation.
   - **AI Prompt Assistance**: The app occasionally suggests conversation starters or replies based on both users' profiles, easing the flow of conversation.



### III. Autopilot Mode
1. **Auto-Matching Interface:**
   - Once the app has gathered enough data, it transitions into **autopilot mode**, where the AI takes over swiping and matching.
   - A **dashboard** offers a clear view of:
     - Automatic matches.
     - Recent conversations.
     - Compatibility analysis.
   - Users can continue swiping manually if they wish, while the AI operates in parallel to present optimal matches.

2. **AI-to-AI Communication:**
   - When a match is made, the user’s AI communicates with the other person’s AI. The AIs engage in simulated conversations, evaluating compatibility based on personality traits, interests, and communication style.
   - If both AIs sense a high degree of compatibility, they share this information with their respective users.

3. **Mutual Match Notification:**
   - Once both AIs agree that the match is promising, the users receive a notification that there’s a mutual match.
   - The message could say something like: *"We've found someone who seems like a great match for you based on your preferences and interactions!"*
   - Users then have the option to engage in conversation with this person.

4. **Match Confirmation:**
   - If the user decides that the match isn’t a good fit after interaction, they can decline the match and the AI will refine future pairings based on this feedback.



### IV. Notifications & Alerts
1. **Match & Conversation Updates:**
   - Users are notified when their AI has identified potential matches through AI-to-AI conversations.
   - The app keeps users informed of key moments, such as when their AI is in discussions with another AI or when mutual compatibility is found.

2. **Interaction Insights:**
   - Notifications on how AI conversations are progressing, with insights like *"Your AI is getting along well with [Match Name]'s AI!"*
   - Users can receive updates on what traits or qualities are being evaluated.



### V. Profile Customization & Settings
1. **Feedback & Learning:**
   - After each match or conversation, users can provide feedback, helping the AI refine its matching and interaction strategies.
   - The AI learns from user input, continuously improving its ability to find meaningful matches.
